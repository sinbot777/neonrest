  <h1>About Neonrest</h1>
  <p><strong>Neonrest</strong> is a people-first social platform designed for closeness, creativity, and calm. Inspired by early internet spaces like MySpace, LiveJournal, and zine culture, Neonrest helps users reconnect through vibe-based neighborhoods, mutual friendships, and expressive content tools.</p>

  <p>The site is currently in active development. Our features already include signups, Markdown-based posts, user profiles, and ambient design elements like rotating taglines and custom neighborhood themes. New users start in <a href="/vibe/Fresh%20Starts" class="dev-link">Fresh Starts</a>, a welcoming space with sketch-style aesthetics and retro vibes.</p>

  <p>We use MailerSend to support transactional emails like sign-up confirmations, password resets, and activity-based opt-in alerts in the near future.</p>

  <p>This domain is owned and operated by <strong>Brenden Kelly</strong>, and this page is published specifically to assist with MailerSend verification. Feel free to reach out at <code>sinbot@gmail.com</code> if you need anything further.</p>
