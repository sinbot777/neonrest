    <h1>About Neonrest</h1>
    <p><strong>Neonrest</strong> is a people-first social network built for closeness — not chaos. It’s a place to slow down, express something honest, and reconnect with friends in ways that feel human again.</p>
    <p>Instead of chasing engagement, we built Neonrest around <em>vibes</em>. You’ll tag posts with emotional tone — not just topics — and settle into <strong>neighborhoods</strong> that feel like home, like <code>Backporch</code>, <code>Analog</code>, or <code>Driftroom</code>.</p>
    <p>We’re blending retro aesthetics and modern tools to create something softer and more intentional. Think beanbags, late-night conversations, mixtapes, and zines — not ads, metrics, or clout.</p>
    <p>We don’t track you, we don’t push you to perform, and we’re not here to win the algorithm. This is a network made by people who miss the web when it felt like <em>ours</em>.</p>
