# Neonrest

**A people-first social network built for closeness — not chaos.**

Neonrest is a softer, more intentional take on social media. Instead of chasing metrics and engagement, it invites users to slow down, express something honest, and reconnect with friends in meaningful ways. Built around Vibe neighborhoods and emotional tags, it's like a digital hangout where mixtapes, late-night convos, and zines feel right at home. No tracking, no clout — just people, presence, and creative connection.
